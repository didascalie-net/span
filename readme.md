# SPAN - Spaces And Nodes
## Environnement for real time media controls and organisation
## Media Data Management Software 

The SPAN project is designed around a JSON file, with : 
* *namespace organisation and discovery
* *event/cues management and sequencement
* *dynamic patch builder
This will work with MIDI, OSC, DMX, ARTNET, PJ-LINK, SERIAL, VISCA and more with the dynamic patch builder.

Even if this first (alpha) version is designed to work with Max 6 from Cycling74, this could/should/must be implemented in more environnements.
