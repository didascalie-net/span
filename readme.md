# SPAN - Spaces And Nodes
## Environnement for real time media controls and organisation
## Media Data Management Software 

The SPAN project is designed around a JSON file, with :    
*    namespace organisation and discovery
*    highly customisation
*    multi-maping with multi-modes
*    event/cues management

Even if this first (alpha) version is designed to work with Max 6 from Cycling74, this could/should/must be implemented in more environnements.
