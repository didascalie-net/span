# SPAN - Spaces And Nodes
## Environnement for real time media control and organisation
## Media Data Management Software 

The SPAN project is designed around a JSON file with :    
*    namespace organisation and discovery    
*    highly customisable    
*    multi-maping with multi-modes    
*    event/cues management    

Even if this first (alpha) version is designed to work with Max 6 from Cycling74, this could/should be implemented in more environnements.

## Startup : 
* Add this package to Applications/Max/packages.
* Add the span abstraction to your Max patch. You can then start to work with it.

## Change Log : 

* Version 0.0.1: First release
